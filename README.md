# IOT-BASED-SMARTDUSTBIN-USING-ARDUINO-UNO

### ABSTRACT
The smart dustbin management system is built on the microcontroller based system having ultrasonic sensors on the dustbin. If dustbin is not maintained than these can cause an unhealthy 
environment and can cause pollute that affect our health.We have designed a smart dustbin using ARDUINO UNO, along with IR Sensor, servo motor, and  jumper wire. After all hardware and software 
connection, now Smart Dustbin program will be run. Dustbin lid will when someone comes near at some range than wait for user to put garbage and close it. Itâ€™s properly 
running or not. For social it will help toward health and hygiene, for business for we try to make it affordable to many as many possible.

### HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
ARDUINO UNO,IR SENSOR,JUMPER WIRES,SERVO MOTOR
